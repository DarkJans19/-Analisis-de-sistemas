## Ant Colony Optimization
The objective of the code is to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), the model works from different functions, among which are generating random city coordinates, calculating the distance between cities, and the which is responsible for the optimization of the ant colony, the vast majority of the code works based on probability, since random cities are generated, and also on the probability that an ant moves from one city to another. The model has several parameters that can be modified to see the behavior of the ants in different cases and there is also a function that is responsible for making 3D graphs of the movement of ants between cities.
